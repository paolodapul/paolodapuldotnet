excerpt: 'To stop your language hopping and make you write more code!'

It is the year 2024, the year in which online writers and content creators put disclaimers on their "hot takes" to avoid getting bashed. As a modern day writer, my disclaimer is that what you will read here are purely based on my personal opinion and biases as an armchair computer scientist<sup>[1]</sup>, on what I think are the **best use cases** of the languages that I like<sup>[2]</sup>.

Now for the list...

**Python**

- "Swiss army knife" language. Useful for scripting and automation.
- When in doubt, write in Python.
- Data science and artificial intelligence. Enough said. It's 2024 you guys!

**Java**

- For writing enterprise, large-scale, soul-crushing, accounts receivable softwarez.
- If you will be writing code to get that sweet paycheck, and you're not planning
  to open-source your code on GitHub, use Java.

**TypeScript**

- Full-stack web development. Hello, Next.js?
- Can scale if you want to (but should you???)

**Go**

- If you need to build compute-heavy, high performance web stuff (now weâ€™re talking!)
- Think real-time, "compute a million lines of data on a server" things.
- My take here becomes extra legit as I have zero lines of Go code in production.

**Rust**

- "I really need to get close to metal but not write Assembly" things.
- High performance CLI/native programs (I guess)

<sup>[1]</sup> Honestly speaking, I just do normie, CRUD things with React and Node.js. Take advice with caution.<br>
<sup>[2]</sup> Also honestly speaking - in a perfect world, you will see me writing really good programs using these languages. Production-grade or go home!
